# Description
This project is carried out within the framework of the multidisciplinary project of the 4th year of engineering at Université Saint-Joseph de Beyrouth.

The goal of this project is to create a flexible and integrated system with a database to allow rapid control of locks through Wi-Fi according to the permissions given to each user. The locks can be manipulated on site by users (teachers , campus staff, etc.) using a numeric keypad attached to each lock, as well as remotely by the administrator using a Web application.

The web application will also allow the administrator to manage the database, manipulate one or more doors with a single click, and create automatic commands that will run on a specific date.

The Project is divided into 3 parts:  
1. Physical Lock  
2. Administrator web app  
3. Application Server and Database

We used Rasberry Pi's for the construction of the locks and a Mosquitto MQTT Broker to communicate between the server and the locks.
